# HHD Music Driver ver.1.5b by Higuchi Hideki with 2608 forced on for PC98
<br/>
<br/>original HHD Music Driver ver.1.5b has? wrong PC-9801-86 sound board detection
<br/>due to this there is no 2608 sound in games like Tenshi-tachi no Gogo ~Tenkousei~ (天使たちの午後 ～転校生～) runed on np2
<br/>there is patched driver to force 2608 turn on instead of 2203
